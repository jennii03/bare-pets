She started out as a hyper pup, but as the years went by and as I grew older, she's lost the will to play and run around like she used to.\n<br><br>\nBARE helped my precious Bailey in a lot of ways - she's happier, and never seems to get tired of playing! I highly recommend their kiddle to anyone who has a pet. A must have indeed ♥\"",
